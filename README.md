# Scavange
A web application that finds recipes from leftover to reduce food waste.
The idea of this application is people tend to buy ingredients more than they acutally need, and most likely, there are leftovers.
We tried to slove this problem by sharing recipes from user's experience and by searching recipes with their leftovers.
